Live site: [TBD]

Working so far: 
- Fetching entries and assets via Firebase API
- Home page, when searching, redirects to /search
- /movies and /tv-shows, when searching, doesn't redirect
- Search term is persistent even when switching pages
- Trending carousel works with scroll snapping using js and ref to scroll with buttons
- Bookmarking and removing bookmarks, along with /bookmarks works fully, managing bookmarks (and search) via Redux

TODO:
- Add github actions for auto building
- Fetching different image sizes according to screen size
- Media queries/responsiveness
- Comment up the code a bit
- Accessibility
- Maybe add authentication at some point

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
